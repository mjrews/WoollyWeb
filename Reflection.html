          </h2>
          <p>I have loved working in Woolly Web, everyone has been very engaged and contributed evenly throughout the time period of the assignment. What worked the best for our group was that everyone was very open and communicated exceptionally. Unfortunately, we had a group member leave our team, but through our consistent and open communication with each other, we were able to keep on track and work efficiently and effectively with each other. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>As our group worked exceptionally well, it is very hard to point at something that could be improved. If I were to say anything, it would be that I wish we left a little more time to polish up Assignments 3 and 5, as we came under a time crunch during the final week of these assessments.  &nbsp;</p>
          <p>I found it surprising that our group managed to bond so well purely over just online Teams calls, as I feel as though I truly have made a genuine connection with all group members.  &nbsp;</p>
          <p>I have learnt just how crucial it is to have an effective communication platform when working within a team. Without our communication platform (Microsoft Teams), we would never have been able to communicate effectively as a team, as well as complete assessments successfully, as we would never have been able to collaborate to the necessary level.   &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <h2>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Thomas Lucchese&nbsp;</span>
          </h2>
          <p>It has been great to work in the Woolly Web group and have enjoyed working with everyone since the start of assessment 2. One of the things that the group did well was communication. Unfortunately, some group members have had personal life issues such as Covid or have had tragic things happen like a loved one passing. The affected members always kept the group up to date so that everyone was aware of what was going on. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>If I were to be honest, there was not much that our group could improve on as our communication and setting of internal deadlines meant that group members were ensuring that allocated tasks were being completed. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>It was surprising to see that our group who only know each other through online and by studying this unity was chatting more casually about anything after we had covered the agenda for the meeting. We were also asking which units everyone is doing after this one and crossing fingers that some of us could be in the same class. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>Two things I have learned is setting deadlines and communication. By setting a deadline and advising the team, everyone knows when to expect to see your completed task by and to communicate when it is done or to let the team know if something happened to prevent you from completing the task. By communicating with the team, the group members know what is going on and know that you still want to contribute instead of the team thinking you have left them to do all the work.  &nbsp;</p>
          <h2>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Jo Haythornthwaite&nbsp;</span>
          </h2>
          <p>Communication was, I believe, the highlight in reflecting upon what went well for our group. Quality communication allowed our group to overcome the barriers that came our way through the course of the unit. As well as this, our team members all came from diverse backgrounds, which meant that each group member brought different skill sets, attributes, and experiences to the group. Fortunately, these skill sets, attributes and experiences were all quite different, which resulted in a positive group outcome. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>We did work together so well that it is difficult to pinpoint specific areas that could have been improved.  However, even though we benefitted from the small break between Assignment 2 and the final two assignments as we had worked so hard to put Assignment 2 together, maybe we could have been a little quicker in beginning Assignments 3 and 5. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>Even though there was a wide range of skills and attributes possessed by the team, I did find it surprising how well they complemented each other and benefited the group.  This has shown that work in groups at university level can be a rewarding and positive experience, which will, hopefully, happen again in the future. &nbsp;</p>
          <h2>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Candice Nafarrete&nbsp;</span>
          </h2>
          <p>Assignment 3 has been quite interesting regarding creating ideas and implementing it as a project idea, which is something I have not previously been exposed to, it was very challenging to juggle the responsibilities of studies as long side with other responsibilities such as full-time work and personal obligations as well as unexpected turns such as becoming ill etc.  &nbsp;</p>
          <p>It was good fun working on Woolly Web and the setup of the advertisement such as the recording. The time spent working with Jo, Mitchell, Thomas and Robert has been valuable, as it has given me experience on what it could be like working in group projects, fortunately, there has been no problems within the group apart from the unforeseen circumstance of Bronson withdrawing from the course. Everyone can agree that communication is the most important aspect when working with others as well as meeting setting up and meeting deadlines. Woolly Web was greatly developed, and I was surprised at how easily possible it was to make an application, though, of course there are some factors that require significant intensive planning.  &nbsp;</p>
          <h2>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Robert Ricketts&nbsp;</span>
          </h2>
          <p>I really enjoyed working with Jo, Candice, Thomas, and Mitch on assessment 2 and now 3. The team worked well together. We overcame a team member leaving the course, they supported me when I was struck down with Covid and when I lost my younger brother to suicide. Good communication and open dialogue were the backbone of the team. Planning and task assignment allowed focus on key assessment areas. Support from team members allowed others to help where it was needed. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>What I found most surprising was the ability of the team to come together with mixed skills and educational backgrounds. Communicating well over teams and establishing a core group with roles that worked well with one another, which we covered in assessment 2. Instead of finding fault they stepped up and supported me with the issues I was facing in my personal life. Their empathy and understanding were evident in everything we discussed.  &nbsp;</p>
          <p>Group activities can be incredibly challenging. More so when you have varying levels of knowledge, age differences and in this case work outside of the course. We lost a key member of the group at the beginning of A3. Very quickly another team member stepped up and took on the role of group leader. Thomas has a natural ability to lead a group. He helped redefine the workload, communicated effectively to others and allowed each of the team members’ core strengths to be employed in the correct areas. As such the dynamic of the group did not change a great deal, which still allowed the group to work well together. Communication, task assignment, intermediate task deadlines and support were essential in achieving the required goals of the group. &nbsp;</p>
          <h2>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Group Feedback </span>
          </h2>
          <p>As noted in our individual reflections, overall, our team has worked well together over the course of this unit. We have constantly emphasized communication, and this has been the key for our success in working together. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>Given this, we would have expected that our work in Assignments 3 and 5 would have continued very smoothly. This has not been the case.  Individually, the challenges we have faced over the past 4 to 5 weeks include COVID, passing of a family member, extended periods of time without power and water, illness, greater than usual work pressures and, to some extent, overall fatigue from our effort in Assignment 2.   &nbsp;</p>
          <p>Even though this did mean that we were unable to fully outline and complete the weekly allocation of tasks table, for two reasons, this did not adversely affect our group. Firstly, when one group member was unable to complete what they needed to do, another member stepped up and completed that task. In addition, when the individual challenges had been overcome that group member came back with their very best effort.  &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <p>In summary:  &nbsp;</p>
          <p><b>What went well</b>  &nbsp;</p>
          <p>Communication was the main strength of our team, with this element highlighting what went well for our group.  As well as this, we all wanted to achieve at as high a level as possible, which was extremely beneficial for our team.  However, in wanting to achieve as highly as possible, each of us understood that challenges did arise in the lives of our team members, so were able to show understanding and empathy.  &nbsp;</p>
          <p><b>What could be improved </b>  &nbsp;</p>
          <p>For the most part, there was little that could be improved that was within our individual and collective control.  Maybe we could have begun Assignments 3 and 5 sooner and more quickly at the beginning.  However, after the big effort that we had put into Assignment 2, we really did need to have a short break before tackling the next assignment.  &nbsp;</p>
          <p><b>At least one thing that was surprising  </b>  &nbsp;</p>
          <p>It was surprising how a group of people who come from a wide range of diverse backgrounds, ages, and locations could come together and work so well together.  Not only was the communication outstanding, we also have developed respect for each other, and have the hope that we will ‘meet’ again in future courses and could work together again.  &nbsp;</p>
          <p><b>At least one thing that you have learned about groups  </b>  &nbsp;</p>
          <p>The highlight of learning about groups was how rewarding the experience can be. It has been an enjoyable and rewarding experience. As well as this, there is absolutely no way that the outcomes and results we have achieved as a group would have occurred if we had completed the assessments individually.  The group collectively benefited from the individual knowledge and skills that we each brought to the group.  &nbsp;</p>
