		</h2>
          <p>Although there are numerous common skills contained within the various roles, the most obvious difference between them is the job itself. Of course, all job roles are IT related, however their core roles and tasks are varied. As an example, programming for game development is markedly different to programming for application design and development. A senior game developer position could be an individual position without collaboration in a small development studio, as could that of a full stack developer. In a larger studio or business, the roles could be senior with many years of experience required. 
Cyber security analyst and Senior ICT Support would initially be junior based or supportive roles and require a greater skill set for working within a team-based environment. 
From the perspective of similarity all the proposed future roles are in the IT field and each of our group members are committed to obtaining the skills required for these future goals. To achieve these career goals, the future roles will all require additional formal education and training, as well as developing skill and experience in the workplace. In addition, completion of the RMIT Bachelor of Information Technology will be of benefit to each of us in achieving our goals. 
However, there are differences. Mitchell and Thomas, with their respective goals of Senior Game Developer and Software Engineer wish to head in the direction of IT development. In contrast, Robert, Candice and Jo, with their respective goals of Cyber Security Program Business Analyst, Cyber Security Program Business Analyst and Senior ICT Support will be focussed on the consultation element of IT. Considering these differing directions, and following the completion of Bachelor of Information Technology, formal future training will take different directions. As an example, Candice and Robert, who wish to specialise in the area of cyber security may benefit by completing a course such as a Graduate Certificate in Cyber Security. &nbsp;</p>

<p>As noted, we are currently developing the Woolly Web app using GlideApps. Glide has worked very well for us in progressing our project to this stage. However, Glide does have its limitations.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>These limitations include:   &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Customisation beyond colour, text and layout is not possible with Glide, so there can be challenges in finding the right template for your needs (Glide Apps Review [Updated 2022], 2022) </li>
  <li>Glide does not have the capacity for a 1:1 private messaging system (Glide App Review: Can You Build an App with No Code? | The Aloa Blog, 2022) </li>
  <li>The app has refresh rates of up to 3 minutes, meaning that it can take up to 3 minutes for Glide to show new data. This means that real time features, such as a live chat probably not work with Glide (Glide App Review: Can You Build an App with No Code? | The Aloa Blog, 2022).  </li>
</ul>
<p>Despite these limitations, Glide is fit for purpose for the current state of the development of the Woolly Web App.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if a group of venture capitalists heard about our Woolly Web project and were so impressed that they wished to develop it for a further 6 months, Glide may have limited application.  &nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, to take the development of this app further, the technical skills that Woolly Web would require include:  &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>HTML/CSS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
  <li>JavaScript libraries </li>
  <li>React.js </li>
  <li>Node.js </li>
  <li>Express.js </li>
  <li>MongoDB </li>
  <li>Database structuring/engineering </li>
  <li>Database and backend security </li>
  <li>Frontend design </li>
  <li>Knowledge of cloud computing services </li>
  <li>API structure (REST) </li>
  <li>API usage </li>
  <li>Email services (Mailchimp) </li>
  <li>Oauth 2.0 </li>
  <li>Payment API (application program interface) </li>
  <li>Apple Swift (Apple iOS) </li>
  <li>Android Kotlin (Android OS) </li>
</ul>
<p>In collating this list of required technical skills, we note that security is of foremost importance in any app that stores user data. We acknowledge that our team may not yet have the skills to store sensitive data, such as passwords and payment information with a high level of security. For this reason, we emphasize that the handling of passwords and payment information will be done with third party platforms, such as OAuth and Stripe   &nbsp;</p>
<p>If a group of venture capitalists heard about our Woolly Web project and wished to develop it for a further 6 months, we would need a small team to work with us as we develop and launch this app. As manager of the team of four who are going to deliver the project outcomes over the next 6 months, we have identified the four required roles. These roles are namely Senior Front End Developer, Senior Java Developer, Database Administrator and Cybersecurity Analyst. As this team of four will be working closely together in the development and launch of the app, we highlight that not only do these roles require strong technical skills, as outlined in the job descriptions, but also evidence of innovative thinking, leadership and management ability, along with evidence of ability to work well in teams.  &nbsp;</p>
