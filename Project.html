          </h2>
          <h3>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Topic &nbsp;</span>
          </h3>
          <p>There are many applications in the market, especially as most people now own a smart device. An article written by Mansoor Iqball suggests that there over 7 million apps now available on both Apple Store and Google Play (Mansoor Iqball, 2022). These applications are available to download, and range from social media and dating apps, fitness apps, along with streaming services such as Netflix and Spotify. There are even mobile apps and video games designed for people to play on the go. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>However, we have identified a hobby activity that have limited applications, namely knitting and crocheting. Our teamâ€™s project idea is to develop an application for mobile phones and tablets, where an individual can keep track of the location of their yarn in their home, as well a database to keep the details about the yarn they have in their home.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>Crocheting and knitting are hobbies that millions of people worldwide enjoy (2022). These relaxing hobbies allow people to create items such as clothing, blankets, household items and even patterns and designs which can be displayed and framed on walls. One of the design challenges when knitting or crocheting is work out if there is enough yarn to complete a project. As well as this it can be challenging to try to work out colours that work well together. Various projects require different amounts of yarn and finding out exactly how much yarn is needed to create an item may not be readily available on the internet. This can result in too little yarn being purchased, which can delay the project. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>Alternatively, those who knit, or crochet, can buy more than is needed for a particular project. This can result in spare yarn from a completed project being stored somewhere around the house in storage boxes either under furniture, in wardrobes or other locations around the house. Over time, there is a good chance of the individual forgetting where they stored the yarn, which can, in turn, lead to purchasing more yarn than is required for the next project. Our team, Woolly Web, aims to create a database in which the user can keep track of where their yarn is stored in their house, as well a variety of relevant details, so that an individual knows where they have stored the yarn, as well as what kind they have. &nbsp;</p>
          <h3>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Motivation &nbsp;</span>
          </h3>
          <p>Knitting and crocheting has always been a popular past time or hobby. Along with more that 28 million people worldwide who knit or crochet (2022) one of our group members crochets as a hobby. In recent times, crocheting (2022) and knitting (Mark, 2022) have increased in popularity as a way of reducing stress and anxiety associated with Covid. This popularity has been further increased with high profile personalities such as Michelle Obama (Login â€¢ Instagram, 2022) and UK diver, Tom Daly (Made with Love by Tom Daley, 2022), sharing their skills on social media. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>This has resulted in a surge on social media groups relating to these hobbies. As an example, during Covid, the Instagram page for We are Knitters grew to about 3 million followers. (Lois Alter Mark, 2020). Our teamâ€™s project idea to develop an application for mobile phones and tablets, where an individual can keep track of the location of their yarn or wool in their home, as well a database to keep the details about the yarn they have in their home, taps into this growing market. &nbsp;</p>
          <h3>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Landscape &nbsp;</span>
          </h3>
          <p>Our Woolly Web App does have some features in common with current apps. We are Knitters (We are Knitters, 2022) is a site that allows users to purchase kits, materials, and yarn, as well as tutorials on how to knit and crochet. Social media apps like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube and etc allow content creators to post videos of tips and tricks, as well as videos of themselves creating their own projects like clothing items or patterns which users can watch and follow.  Finally, Stash2Go (10 Crochet Apps You Need to Try, 2022) is a similar app which stores projects and kits in a database like our app. Despite extensive investigation we were unable to find other yarns apps that were similar in nature, leading us to believe that our Woolly Web App does have significant differences to current available apps. The reason for this is that we will also have a database for yarn materials, as well the map which pinpoints where the materials are in a household. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
          <h2>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Detailed Description â€“ Woolly Web &nbsp;</span>
          </h2>
          <p>The overall aim of the Woolly Web app is to design a database-type app where users who crochet or knit can store a range of information that will assist them in manage and enjoy these activities even more than they already do. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>This will include information about their supply of yarn, kits they have completed, or current projects that they may be working on. This is valuable data for the user, should they need to check what their supply is like before starting a new project, or if they are needing to refer to the app to locate their stock. This will be done by first creating a database within the app where users can enter information about the yarn that they have at home. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>The Woolly Webs will create the app using an application â€˜Glide.â€™  This will allow all members to collaborate on developing the application no matter their current background in IT. We also hope to design the user interface (UI) ourselves but if this is not possible, we will use a free template and heavily edit it to be unique. Through using Glide, we hope to construct at least 3 databases, one for yarn supplies, one for kits, crocheting hooks and knitting needles and one for projects. These categories would allow the user to select enter entries for yarns and kits in separate tabs which allows for searching for a specific item be a lot simpler than if it were all combined into one. We would also want to construct another tab called projects. In this tab we would allow users to catalogue all completed and current projects to keep track of and share their completed projects with other people as well as an option to browse projects for the user to start if they need inspiration. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>As our time to develop this app is limited, we will focus all our time and energy on the yarn and tab. We believe that this tab will be the key feature of the app and is what makes our app unique, as well as being the main feature of the app. Without the database, the really is no app and it just becomes an app or site with tutorials, like many that are already available over the internet and social media. &nbsp;</p>
          <h3>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Plans and Progress &nbsp;</span>
          </h3>
          <p>The app will have several features. Some features will be free, while others will be premium features that will be locked behind a paywall. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>The main feature of the will be a database system where users can enter different pieces of information about materials and yarn they have at home, as well as kits and current and completed projects the user is working on. At this stage of development, the database will have three tabs at the top of the page, so that users can sort their yarn, kits and projects in progress or completed separately. It will appear as a list and users can tap their selected entry to find out more about their materials. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>The first tab will be about the yarn. The user of the app will be able to add in a range of information about the yarn that they have on hand for their projects. This information will include: &nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Yarn Brand and name </li>
            <li>Colour, colour number and dye lot </li>
            <li>Amount of Yarn (both in weight and meterage) </li>
            <li>Fibre Type e.g., acrylic, cotton, cotton/bamboo blend etc., along with yarn weight e.g., 4 ply </li>
            <li>Hook/needle size </li>
            <li>Care Instructions </li>
            <li>Where and when yarn was purchased, along with the price </li>
            <li>Location of the yarn in the house </li>
            <li>photo </li>
          </ul>
          <p>All this information will be important to the knitter or crocheter who requires information regarding the storage of their yarn.  Recording of these details will not only allow the crocheter of knitter to what yarn they have, but also how much yarn, the type of yarn and the suitability of the yarn for their project. &nbsp;</p>
          <img src="images/Materials.png" alt="Materials">
          <p>The next tab will be for users to add their kits in the database. These could be kits which the user may have purchased to make a particular pattern or object, or it could be a kit that the user has put together themselves as a future project. It will also include the knitting needles or crochet hooks required for the project. The below will be the types of information that can be entered for kits: &nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Name of Kit </li>
            <li>Photo of the box the kit is stored in </li>
            <li>Location of where it is stored </li>
            <li>Progress of completion (this would be either be not started, in progress or completed)</li>
            <li>Size of knitting needles or crochet hooks (in mm) </li>
            <li>Photo of the needles or hooks (can be a photo of the box they are stored in) </li>
            <li>Location these are stored </li>
          </ul>
          <img src="images/Kits.png" alt="Kits">
          <p>The third tab in the database will be a section where users can enter their own projects that they are working on. This will be done by creating a new project through themselves through the app, or by browsing through an existing catalogue where users can select a project and add it to their profile. Creating a new project will confirm that they are currently â€˜workingâ€™ on creating a particular item. When adding a project to their database, the options will include: &nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Name of the Project </li>
            <li>Type of item being created e.g., blanket, clothing and type of clothing, household item etc. </li>
            <li>Start Date</li>
            <li>Status of the Project (When completed is selected, the completion date will be filled in automatically) </li>
          </ul>
          <p>The projects will be sorted in a completed tab once marked as completed, so that users can easily sort which projects are current and which ones have been completed. A picture of the completed project can also then be uploaded. This will allow the user to look back or share the completed item. &nbsp;</p>
          <img src="images/Projects.png" alt="Projects">
          <p>The second feature of the app will be a mapping system.  This mapping system will allow the user to create a layout of their home. From here, rooms can be labelled, which will allow a user to look up a layout of their home to easily identify where the material and kits have been stored around the house. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>The app will be free to download on the app store or Google Play Store. Most of the features will be available for all users but there will be a monetised element. We will implement this by having a storage limit to the database, where users can store a limited number of kits and yarn in their app e.g., free users may have up to 50 different entries. This would also mean that users could sign into their Google Accounts, Facebook accounts or create their own account within the app, so that they can view their own database anytime, anywhere. Small advertisements which appear as like a small box on the bottom of the screen will also be present, as well as other premium features which will be locked behind a once off payment. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>These premium features may include the permanent removal of advertisements and advanced guides or tutorials, where users can watch to learn more skills or brush up on crochet or knitting techniques. The database limit will also be removed, meaning that users with premium access can store as much data as they wish. The catalogue in the 3rd tab, projects, will also be extended from just one page, meaning that users will be able to browse more projects if they are needing inspiration. The cost for these premium features is still to be determined. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>We also have the option to sign into Google or Facebook accounts to ensure the users data is saved on a cloud. This would mean that the user can access their data between devices which is useful for when phones or devices are upgraded. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>Below are the steps that will be taken to develop the app along with, where and if required, additional information regarding each of these steps: &nbsp;</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Obtain the relevant tools needed to develop the app </li>
            <li>Develop the database for the 3 features (Materials, Kits, Projects)  </li>
            <li>Test the database and it ensure that it works for both viewing and adding additional entries </li>
            <li>Manage the app </li>
            <li>Test the app </li>
            <li>Add Premium Features (such as the advanced tutorials and videos) </li>
            <li>Final Test & Debugging </li>
            <li>Launch App </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Obtain the relevant tools needed to develop the app &nbsp;</span>
          </h4>
          <p>The main tool needed at this stage is GlideApps.  Glide is an online platform that transforms data from spreadsheets, such as Google Sheet or Excel into mobile apps that fit on iOS and Android phones and tablets. (GlideApps - A mobile application generator without code, 2022).  Each team member has spent quite some time in familiarising themselves with the app so that, if required, we would all be able to continue  &nbsp;</p>
          <h4>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Develop the database for the 3 features (Materials, Kits, Projects)  &nbsp;</span>
          </h4>
          <p>As mentioned earlier, our app will be 3 databases for the features of yarns/materials, kits and projects. However, we anticipate that, due to the constraints of time, our focus will be to begin the development of the database for the materials/yarns. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>Development of the kits and projects tabs will occur after the completion of Assignment 3 and will be included in the table that reflects our best guess as to how the remaining time 10 weeks will work. &nbsp;</p>
          <h4>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Test the database and it ensure that it works for both viewing and adding additional entries  &nbsp;</span>
          </h4>
          <p>With Glide being relatively straightforward to use, the testing of the database to ensure that it works for both the viewing and addition of entries has been relatively straightforward.  This process has been managed well, as all team members have worked on an ongoing basis to ensure that their understanding and ability to use the app has improved over the course of working as a team. Each time additional data is entered into the app, we have been able to check and ensure that these elements are working well. &nbsp;</p>
          <h4>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Manage the app &nbsp;</span>
          </h4>
          <p>The app will initially be hosted with Apple and Android via their respective online stores. Apple App Store and Google Play store utilise their own servers as well as payment systems. Unfortunately, this comes at a price, where both take 30% as fees from all sales. As the app gains popularity and income increases it could then be hosted on a business provided server/cloud-based distribution platform. Costs would vary depending on provider. One provider is Amazon Web Services (AWS). Amazon Web Services offers SAAS, using AWS Cloud Front. The funds that were being diverted to Apple/Android would then be used to host the app using AWS. The screen shot below shows the kinds of service we may require. &nbsp;</p>
          <img src="images/aws.png" alt="aws">
          <h4>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Test the app &nbsp;</span>
          </h4>
          <p>Our process for testing the app is summarised in the â€˜testingâ€™ section below. &nbsp;</p>
          <h4>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Add Premium Features (such as the advanced tutorials and videos)  &nbsp;</span>
          </h4>
          <p>As a premium feature, tutorials and videos are not the highest priority.  However, we would anticipate development of these app elements in the 10 weeks after Assignment 3 submission. &nbsp;</p>
          <h4>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Final Test & Debugging &nbsp;</span>
          </h4>
          <p>Our process for final testing and debugging the app is discussed in the â€˜testingâ€™ section below.  &nbsp;</p>
          <h4>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Launch App &nbsp;</span>
          </h4>
          <p>It is anticipated that the app launch would be formally launched towards the end of the 6 months of funding by the venture capitalistsâ€ƒ &nbsp;</p>
          <p>In summarising, we hope that by developing the Woolly Web App, the user will be able to easily keep track of their inventory in terms of what they have, how much yarn they have left and where it is stored within their household. Over time, our team would hope that the app becomes popular and recommended for both beginners and experienced crocheters and knitters. The Woolly Web app will allow them to learn techniques, practise additional skills and techniques that they may need or would like, as well as keeping on top of their inventory so that the user does not purchase more materials than needed. &nbsp;</p>  
          <p>If the app becomes successful, it could have potential to branch out to other hobbies. This may include gaming, where a user could keep track of any hard copy games they may have and sort them via the console they are compatible with, or woodworking and building projects where the user wishes to keep track of what materials they have, the quantity and where it is stored. &nbsp;</p>

          <h3>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Roles &nbsp;</span>
          </h3> 
          <p>We have elected to not define specific roles for team members for our project. Although this may be contrary to advice as to the best course of action, there are reasons why our team is confident that this approach will have a positive outcome.  &nbsp;</p>
          <p>Firstly, we believe that the strength of our team is communication, so we are confident that through communication we will achieve at the highest level possible.  We used this approach successfully in Assignment 2, so have no reason to believe that this approach will not be successful in Assignments 3 and 5.  This approach has allowed us to organise and allocate tasks where there is the most need.  However, in general terms, and acknowledging that there is a great deal of overlap, Robert, Candice and Jo have focussed on Assignment 3 while Mitchell and Thomas have focussed on Assignment 5.  &nbsp;</p>

          <h3>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Scope and Limits &nbsp;</span>
          </h3> 
          <p>As mentioned, the goal of the Woolly Web app is to construct 3 databases, one for yarn supplies, one for kits, crocheting hooks and knitting needles and one for projects, as well as eventually adding tutorial and learning opportunities for crocheters and knitters alike. Due to the limited available time, the scope of the project will be limited to developing an artefact that shows how the yarn tab of our project will be displayed on Glide.  We have not found an easily accessible app on the market with this feature.  Given this, our approximately 100 entries in this tab demonstrates the potential versatility of the app when and if we were able to expand the app to include the kits and projects tabs, as well as potential tutorials and learning opportunities.  &nbsp;</p>
          <p>Other elements of the app, including the kits tabs, the projects tab and the mapping system, along with features behind the paywall such as online tutorials and patterns are beyond the scope of Assignment 3.  &nbsp;</p>

          <h3>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Tools and Technologies  &nbsp;</span>
          </h3> 
          <p>In assignment 2, we outlined in some detail the tools and technologies that we would use in the design of this application. For reference, this detail has been transferred below. &nbsp;</p>
          <p><i>The project will mainly be an app. A website would also be ideal for marketing and the downloading of tutorials. The project will also need a database, web server, and front end. This project could use any combination of tools to achieve this, but we believe that the ideal tools would be MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. This combination of tools is known as the MERN stack (Islam, 2022). </i> &nbsp;</p>
          <p><i>The main reason for using React.js is that if React Native is used, the mobile app and website can be deployed from a single codebase. React is used for reactive websites, where content can be dynamically updated. This feature of React is not of highest importance to the app.  However, the components feature of React is of highest importance. Components are modular and re-usable parts of a website (React Components, 2022). As an example, Uber Eats uses React for this purpose (Lewis and Dean, 2022). If you were to search for food in Melbourne on Uber Eats, each restaurant and menu item uses a component to display the information about the restaurant and its food. Uber Eats does not have to write code for each item. They simply use the corresponding components and add the description, title, and pictures as parameters to pass to the component. Our Woolly Web Abb would operate in a similar way, where every tutorial uses the same component and has its content passed to it as parameters. </i> &nbsp;</p>
          <p><i>Express.js and Node.js work together to form the backend of the project. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows JavaScript to be used to write server code while Express.js is a library that makes Node.js easier to use (Node.js vs Express.js - GeeksforGeeks, 2022). The Node server will be written in the style of an Application Programming Interface (API). Using HTTP requests, the React frontend and the Node backend will communicate with each other. While it is possible to use a React frontend with any backend, and it is similarly possible to use a Node/Express backend with any frontend, the two are well suited for each other.  The reason for this is that both use JavaScript and the React DOM (Document Object Model) even has many built-in components that are to be used with Node (Kasundra, 2022). As stated earlier, the server will be written as an API. This will make the app far easier to modify and change when required. APIs are another one of Nodeâ€™s strong features, as Node is lightweight and able to handle many simultaneous requests. </i> &nbsp;</p>
          <p><i>MongoDB will be used to store data in the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. JSON is a good fit for the project as it is better than SQL at storing â€˜one to manyâ€™ data (Yu, n.d.). This means that many different pieces of data will be created by, and related, to a single user. For example, Twitter uses JSON as users may have many tweets from a one account. The JSON format is also a good fit for both React and Node/Express. Many of Reactâ€™s functions require JSON to be used and data from JSON objects can very easily be used by the Node backend. </i> &nbsp;</p>
          <p>However, since the completion and submission of Assessment 2, one of our team members has, for personal reasons, needed to withdraw from the course. This person had the strongest technical ability of all team members. The intent was that they would take the lead and guide our team in the right direction from a technical perspective. Given this loss of technical ability, we have had to re-evaluate where our team skills lie. For this reason, we have selected the Glide app as the main tool to progress the project for the time being. &nbsp;</p>

          <h3>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Testing &nbsp;</span>
          </h3> 
          <p>The Woolly Web app will be released in different stages of development. The first stage will be an early alpha version where we have built the main features of the app such as the database with the 3 main areas which are the materials. Kits and the projects. This is so a select group of users can test the app at this stage and using a survey, let us know what they like, what they donâ€™t like as well as any suggestions the user has which we can use to improve our application further.  &nbsp;</p>
          <p>The development team will then take these surveys and work on the suggestions and fix any bugs or issues that the alpha testers had when testing the app. Once these features and fixes are complete, start adding the premium features (which will be automatically unlocked for all beta testers) we will release a beta version of the app to a larger group of users to test. The same format will apply here where users who are trying the app can send us a survey of what they liked, didnâ€™t like and any bugs or issues that they had come across. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>Once the beta test is complete, the development team will look at the feedback that was provided to us by the testers. They will look at the surveys and see what can be improved and fix and app breaking bugs and add quality of life changes to the app which will benefit all users. The last thing the developers will add and test themselves will be the premium features. Once they have confirmed that free users have restrictions applied and that once paid, these will disappear, we will then release the app as the full version to both the App Store and Google Play store for all users of Apple and Android devices to download and use.  &nbsp;</p>
          <p>The team will keep an eye out for the reviews and note of any constrictive feedback from user reviews to try and improve the app should there be any bugs or common issues or new features we missed during the alpha and beta testing and release these as updates when they are completed. &nbsp;</p>

          <h3>
            <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Timeframe &nbsp;</span>
          </h3> 
          <p>As a team, we began Assignment 3 with the best of intentions by establishing a weekly task allocation chart.  Initially, the task allocation chart was an excellent working document and did work well.  However, as is outlined in our group reflection, we did, as a group, face an extraordinarily high number of personal challenges through the course of this group project.  For this reason, towards the end of the project the goal was simply to keep working hard individually to bring the project together collectively.  &nbsp;</p>
          <p>Due to the challenges, the specifics of our task allocation, as can be seen in the chart below, became far less detailed or specific.  &nbsp;</p>

        <h3>
          <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Risks &nbsp;</span>
        </h3> 
        <h4>
          <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Change of team personnel &nbsp;</span>
        </h4>
        <p>In developing any app or working on any group project, such Assignments 2, 3 and 5, there is always a risk of a change of team personnel.  This occurred for our team with, for personal reasons, the loss of one of our team members.  In addition, the loss of this member created a great technical loss to the team.  However, this loss of technical ability has created the opportunity for other team members to learn, step up and develop their technical abilities.  &nbsp;</p>
        <p>For this reason, we will view the potential loss, or change of, team personnel as not only a challenge, but also an opportunity.  &nbsp;</p>
        <h4>
          <span class="u-text-palette-1-base">Budgetary constraints and financial challenges  &nbsp;</span>
        </h4>
        <p>The development of any new app comes with budgetary risks and financial challenges.  With the goal of being at least cost neutral, the following outlines how we anticipate funding the development of the Woolly Web app.  &nbsp;</p>
        <p>To mitigate the risk of failure of the Woolly Web app for financial reasons, we have outlined our anticipated expenses over the 6-month timeframe where we are being assisted by the venture capitalists, as well as potential and likely income sources.  &nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Expenses (anticipated)</b> &nbsp;</p>
        <p>We anticipate $56,154 per month ($336,924 â€“ 6 months) in direct expenses for 4 employees, development, advertising, and maintenance. There will be no hosting costs if the app is hosted on Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Both Apple and Google will take 30% percent of sales revenue. The expenses we have calculated so far are:  &nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Glide for Business = $249/month  </li>
          <li>Employee Wages = $50,000/month   </li>
          <li>Advertising = $767/month ($9210) </li>
          <li>Google Dev Account = $2/month  </li>
          <li>Apple Dev Account = $36/month ($440 Enterprise Fee)  </li>
          <li>Apple Store Commision (30%) $288,000 = $86,400 = $14,400/month  </li>
          <li>Google Store Commision (30%) $288,000 = $86,400 = $14,400/month  </li>
          <li>Paid premium subscription â€“ uncertain, with the following being a guide:  </li>
